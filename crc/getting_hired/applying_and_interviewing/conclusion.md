### Final words



Before you move on from the course, we would like your feedback [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenziSaFuSQ3RFeHwn1YHovQj-G-WmNZc-_dgMuV_JcGB25Cg/viewform?usp=sf_link). Getting user(you) feedback is important so we can continue to improve the curriculum and get an idea of your experience.  

So build some kick ass software, learn as much as you can, and pay it forward when you're able.  **Thanks for participating in the project!!!**
