Lessons are structured through a combination of original written content and a compilation of carefully curated resources from the web. This is where the contributing happens!



Our community can be found on the [TOP Discord server](https://discord.gg/).

## Contributing



Some of the things you can do to contribute to our curriculum include:
* Correct typos and other grammar errors.
* Rewrite parts of existing lessons to make them clearer and easier to understand.
* Fix broken links.
* Add new resource links you think would make a lesson better.
* Work on entirely new lessons after getting approval.

**Happy Coding!**
